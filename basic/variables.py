#varibales are data storage. It can contain different types of data
#Identifier is the name of a Variable, function, class, file name

a = 10
# "a" is a variable because it is storing a data(number). But a is also an identifier because it is naming a variable

# Rules: To name a variable
# We use alphanumeric characters and a special character underscore(_). Except these chars we cant use any other char

#One important rule: Any varible name cant start with a number, it can start with alphabets or underscore
#Varible name are case sensitive. means : apple Apple ApPlE APPLE .... all are different names

apple = "lowercase"
APPLE = "uppercase"

print(apple,APPLE) #apple -> lowercase & APPLE -> uppercase

apple = "uppercase"
apple = APPLE 
print(apple,APPLE)


# In programming (i.e any programming language) we use certain conventions in naming identifiers
# 3 Naming conventions for naming a variable with multiple words: 

totalvolumeofsphere = 10

# camel case
totalVolumeOfSphere = 1

# pascal case
TotalVolumeOfSphere = 2

# Snake Case
total_volume_of_sphere = 3


# Assgining multiple values: Keep in mind to put same no of variables and literal values
sahil , soumya = 94.6 , 89.4 

print (sahil,soumya)

country = motherland = "INdia"
